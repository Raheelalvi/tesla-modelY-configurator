This project is inspired by the latest YouTube video from Traversy Media (link below). While he built the project using vanilla JavaScript, I used the following technologies:
1. React JS
2. Zustand (for state management)
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Daisy UI (for checkboxes)
5. Animate CSS (for banner animation)

One of the main reasons I built this project was to experiment with viewport splitting for dual scroll functionality, something I hadn't come across before.
