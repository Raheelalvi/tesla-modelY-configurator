This project is inspired by the latest YouTube video from Traversy Media (link below). While he built the project using vanilla JavaScript, I used the following technologies:
1. React JS
2. Zustand (for state management)
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Daisy UI (for checkboxes)
5. Animate CSS (for banner animation)

One of the main reasons I built this project was to experiment with viewport splitting for dual scroll functionality, something I hadn't come across before.
The user can select different color variations (both exterior and interior) for the Tesla Model Y. The image of the car updates to reflect the selected color. Additionally, the user can choose between standard or performance wheels, with the image updating accordingly. The user can also select add-on accessories, which will adjust the final price of the car. Furthermore, the monthly installment package is displayed, showing a detailed price breakdown.
